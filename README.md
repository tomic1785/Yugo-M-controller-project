# Yugo-M-controller-project
The STM32-based controller for IBM Model M keyboards

Yugo-M is a drop-in replacement for the original PS/2 controller. It connects to PC (or other devices) via USB, and it is programmable. By default it runs QMK firmware, but you can flash it with any firmware compatible with STM32 chip, or you can write your own firmware.
